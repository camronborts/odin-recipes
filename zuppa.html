          <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
          <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
          <li>5 cans chicken broth</li>
          <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>

  <div class="two"></div>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</p>
